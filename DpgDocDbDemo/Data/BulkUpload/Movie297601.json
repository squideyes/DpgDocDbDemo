  "Status": "Released",
  "Overview": "Scored to Gabriel Fauré’s well-known Requiem in D-Minor and shot in stark black and white with a crew of refugees who felt the urgency to convey their situation to the world, A REQUIEM FOR SYRIAN REFUGEES is a wrenching portrait of survival, resilience and empowerment in the camps of Northern Iraq. An intimate perspective on the daily lives and emotions of their fellow refugees, REQUIEM is also a poignant reminder of the civilian toll and trauma of 21st Century wars and an alarm sounded against indifference to the suffering and courage of millions, a non-partisan call for humanity and compassion.",
