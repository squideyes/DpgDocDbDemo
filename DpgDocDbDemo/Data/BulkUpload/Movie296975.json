  "Overview": "The Met season opens with Music Director James Levine conducting a new production of Mozartâ€™s eternal masterpiece, directed by Richard Eyre, who sets the action in a 18th-century manor house in Seville during the 1930s. Dashing bass-baritone Ildar Abdrazakov, our Figaro, leads a dazzling cast, including Marlis Petersen as his bride, Susanna, Peter Mattei as the philandering Count, Amanda Majeski as the long-suffering Countess, and Isabel Leonard as the libidinous pageboy Cherubino. Designer Rob Howell (Carmen, Werther) utilizes a revolving set to keep the story bubbling along.",
